Please load the entire repository in the local machine....

the workspace/training_demo contains the trained model....

Use the file "load_model.ipynb" to run the model....

Before running the model, make sure to checkout and configure your machine with Tensorflow directories.

Check out the : https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10/blob/master/Object_detection_image.py - For Tensorflow 1 

and 

complete lessons on the  Tensorflow2 installation and training your own custom object detection model is provided in the below link

https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html



I have used the ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8 model to train my custom model.

Images used for training and testing the model is provided in the workspace/training_demo/images folder.


Enjoy!!!!
Happy coding!
